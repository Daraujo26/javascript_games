# JavaScript Games

Included are two games I made using simple DOM manipulation.

## Craps rules

You win if a 7 or 11 roll, or lose if 2, 3, or 12 roll (known as “craps”). Any other number that rolls becomes the “point” and the point must roll again before a 7 to win.

## Uno rules

## How to play

There are many ways, but I prefer just opening a Webstorm or IntelliJ window and viewing or launching the two index.html files.
